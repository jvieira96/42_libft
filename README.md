# 📚 Libft - 42 School Project

## 📋 Project Overview

**Libft** is a foundational project where you recreate a personal C standard library. The goal is to implement a set of essential functions from scratch, covering string manipulation, memory management, character checks, linked lists, and more. The **bonus** part extends the library with additional useful functions and linked list operations.

## 💡 What I Learned

- 🔧 Reimplementing fundamental C library functions to understand their inner workings.
- 📜 Mastering pointer arithmetic and memory manipulation.
- 🧩 Working with strings, arrays, and characters at a low level.
- 🛠 Building and manipulating **linked lists**, including:
  - Creating nodes
  - Adding/removing nodes at front/back
  - Iterating and mapping functions over lists
- 📏 Writing reusable, modular, and well-documented code.
- 🧹 Managing dynamic memory carefully to avoid leaks and errors.
- ✍️ Applying and respecting the 42 Norm coding style rigorously.
- ⚠️ Handling edge cases and invalid inputs gracefully.

## ⚙️ Technical Concepts Used

- Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`)
- Pointer manipulation and arithmetic
- String handling and safe buffer operations
- Implementing abstract data structures (linked lists)
- Function pointers for generic list operations
- Writing robust error handling
- Adhering strictly to coding standards and norms

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- Recreated over 40 core C functions with expected behavior.
- Developed a flexible linked list library supporting common operations.
- Built utility functions that can be reused in future projects.
- Learned to write clean, maintainable, and tested C code.
- Improved debugging and problem-solving skills through manual implementation.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Deep understanding of how standard C library functions work internally.
- Experience writing complex pointer-based data structures.
- Enhanced discipline following strict coding norms.
- Prepared for more advanced projects with a solid codebase foundation.
