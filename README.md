# Libft - 42 Project

Libft is the first project in the 42 curriculum. The goal is to build your own C library by re-implementing common standard library functions and creating some useful additional functions.

This project helped me get solid with:

- Handling pointers and strings  
- Memory management (malloc, free, etc.)  
- Writing reusable, clean, and well-tested C functions  
- Understanding how standard C libraries work under the hood

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- Re-implemented standard C functions like `ft_strlen`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_strchr`, and many more  
- Additional utility functions like `ft_itoa`, `ft_split`, and linked list operations  
- Functions follow the norm and 42 coding style
